AI-Assisted Pulmonary Fibrosis Detection
Overview
This project aims to assist radiologists in detecting Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) through Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered solutions. By analyzing CT scan images, our tool identifies subtle patterns of IPF that may be challenging to detect with the naked eye. The solution not only enhances diagnostic accuracy but also accelerates the process, improving patient outcomes.

Features
Advanced Image Analysis: AI models capable of identifying early signs of IPF.
Automated Report Generation: Detailed diagnostic reports to support radiologists' clinical judgment.
High Sensitivity to Subtle Patterns: Detection of hard-to-spot fibrosis indicators.
